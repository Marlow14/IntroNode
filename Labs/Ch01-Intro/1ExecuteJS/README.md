# Chapter 1: Getting Started with node

## Concepts

1. In your \WIP directory, create a directory structure of 
`\WIP\Ch01\1JS`

1. In this directory create a file called `jspractice.js`

1. In this file create variables to hold your firstName and LastName 

1. Use backticks and template expressions instead of concatenation to display a greeting on two lines as follows:
  Hello
  firstName LastName
 
1. Create another subdirectory: `\WIP\JSchallenges`

1. Open a command prompt to any path. Not within VSCode. Maximize the window.

1. Execute the following command:
  `javascripting`

1. The screen will present a list of challenges to you. Work on the challenges within your newly created `\WIP\JSchallenges` directory.

1. Follow the instructions to verify your work, from a command prompt opened within VSCode.
