1. READ: Here we are NOT looking in the local file system for a module as we are not using path indicators such as "./filename.js"

    Require will look 

use setInterval nd radom to create a number 1 to 20 - when it is 11 - raise an alert 11 sighting! 

runt he code and watch for th eoutout

when exit the program - using process - indicate how many time 11 was sighted.

could do a bigger random generator where it looks for 1111

those listening coudl make a wish

or make note of it somehow

consoe.log - making a wish!
